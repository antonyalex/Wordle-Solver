# Wordle-Solver
A tool to assist you in solving Wordle quickly and efficiently.
Note:This is still a work in progress and so is wildly unoptimized.

This tool employs the principles of [Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) to assign a score to every possible word at each stage of the game. This helps identify the most optimal word choice at every turn.

This project is based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA) insightful video that explains the underlying concepts of how this Wordle solver works.
